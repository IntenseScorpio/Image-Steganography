# **STEGANOGRAPHY MODEL USING LSB & PVD WITH COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**
Steganography is the process of hiding one file inside another such that others can neither identify the meaning of the embedded object, nor even recognize its existence. The main objective of Steganography is mainly concerned with the protection of contents of the hidden information. Images are ideal for information hiding because of the large amount of redundant space is created in the storing of images. Since this can be done in several ways, and two of these methods has been used to demonstrate it in this project.

Our project focuses on the implementation and comparison of two popular image steganography techniques: Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD). The LSB method involves embedding secret data by modifying the least significant bit of each pixel in an image, while the PVD method involves modifying the pixel values of adjacent pixels to hide the secret data. This project aims to compare the performance of these two methods in terms of their capacity to hide secret data, as well as their resistance to attacks and the results of this project will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these two popular image steganography techniques and will help in the selection of the appropriate method based on the desired level of security and capacity requirements.

## Summary
This is a python program to implement Image steganography using LSB and PVD Method. This is just a Experimental Project to test the Efficiency of encryption between PVD and LSB method
